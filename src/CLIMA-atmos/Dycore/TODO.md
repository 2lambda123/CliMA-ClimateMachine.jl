# TODO:

 - Consider how to do logging with MPI
 - Restart files
 - pretty print time info (and track performance issues)
 - asynchronous GPU memory/compute
 - asynchronous i/o
 - callbacks for spatial discretization / each stage of time stepper? (maybe
   needed to handle passive advection)
 - Other time steppers
 - more ICs (error rates)
 - tests?
